# 🍽️ Restaurant Review Analysis Using LLMs (Llama & Mistral)

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on restaurant customer reviews using advanced **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as **Llama** and **Mistral**.  
The notebook automates the extraction of **overall sentiment**, **aspect-based sentiment**, and **feature-level insights** from unstructured text data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Businesses receive thousands of customer reviews every day across online platforms.  
Manually analyzing this unstructured text is:

- ❌ Time-consuming  
- ❌ Prone to bias  
- ❌ Not scalable  

This project solves the problem by using LLMs to:

### ✅ Predict overall sentiment  
### ✅ Analyze sentiments of different aspects (e.g., food, service, ambience)  
### ✅ Extract detailed feature-level insights  
### ✅ Generate a summary response for business decision-making

## 🎯 Objective

Build an automated and scalable system that uses LLMs to:

- Perform **sentiment classification**
- Extract **structured JSON** outputs from model responses
- Analyze **aspects** like:
  - Food  
  - Service  
  - Ambience  
  - Price  
- Provide **explainable insights** for restaurants
